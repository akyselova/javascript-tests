Title: Impossible to filter cars by model

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to https://www.carnext.com/en-be/cars
2. Filter list by car mark (e.g BMW)
3. Filter list by model (e.g 4 gran coupe)
4. Check displayed list of cars

Actual result: List contain all models of chosen mark - filtering didn't occur (see attached video)
Expected result: List should be filtered by model instantly after corresponding selection occurred (user checked model checkbox)
